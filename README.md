# Perceptrons, and Neural Networks for Text Classification

Implement and Evaluate Perceptrons for text classification.

Implemented the perceptron algorithm (used the perceptron training rule and not the gradient descent rule). Experimented with different values of number of iterations and the learning rate. Repeated your experiment by filtering out the stop words. Compared the accuracy of your perceptron implementation with that of Naive Bayes (implemented in https://github.com/Banu-Prasanth-Pulicharla/naive-bayes-text-classfication).
